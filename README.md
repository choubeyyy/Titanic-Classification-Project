## Objective

🚢 Create a system to predict whether a person would survive the sinking of the Titanic. Identify key factors leading to survival, such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and more.

## Dataset

📊 The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and includes information about Titanic passengers, such as class, age, gender, and more.

## Project Structure

📂 This project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and modeling.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data cleaning, feature engineering, and model training.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Results
📈 Key insights from the analysis:

## Future Improvements
🔮 Future enhancements to this project can include:

Fine-tuning machine learning models for better accuracy.
Exploring additional features influencing survival.
Developing a user-friendly interface for predictions.
